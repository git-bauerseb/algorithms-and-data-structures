# Chapter 1

## 1.1-1

**Sorting**: Soring colors, weights

**Convex Hull**: Determine length of banner along a set of poles


## 1.1-2

Space, Access to memory-locations, Robustness (for probabilistic algorithms)

## 1.1-3

Stack:

+ Access of last element easy
- Traversal of whole stack for finding element

## 1.1-4

Shortest-path: Shortest path from node A to B

Traveling-salesman: Shortest path from node A to itself, visiting every other node. So TSP is the problem of finding a shortest path to every other node going back to the original one.

## 1.1-5

Only best: Sorting

Approx.: Shortest-path for post man. It's not necessary to find shortest path to every location.
