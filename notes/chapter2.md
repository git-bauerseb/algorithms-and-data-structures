# Chapter 2

## Exercises

### 2.3-2

Done in implementation

### 2.3-4

Recursive insertion sort
Implemented

### 2.3-5

Binary search
Implemented

### 2.3-6

No, as in the linear search we move the elements to the right. Thus, even if binary search is used, we would still need to move the elements to the right which does not decrease runtime.

### 2.3-7

Given set S of n integers and another integer x, determine whether there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.
