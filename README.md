# About

This repository will contain the implementation of most of the algorithms in the **Introduction to Algorithms** book.

The implementation is done for learning in C++ and serves as a basis for other projects that may need those algorithms.

## Covered

### Data structures

- Stack
- Queue


## Structure

- **i2a**: Contains implementation of the book
- **   **: Contains other implementations
